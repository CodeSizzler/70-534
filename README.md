70-534 Exam Certification

Azure Certification Jump Start Events (Training for Architecting Azure Solutions 70-534 exam).  
This is the first step for technical staff.  The target audience is primarily architects, developers and engineers but may be useful for managers to sit in and learn the breadth of the capabilities available to them, the challenges teams will face and how they can be overcome.  This training is usually delivered in person to 30-120 technical staff.  It can also be broadcast or simulcast to other locations giving a global organization an inexpensive and fast delivery option around the world.  Many of these events can be scheduled and broadcast to fit multiple locations and time zones.  The best approach is to leverage locations that have at least 40 technical staff taking the training. 
Customer Quotes:
	· “This is a great way to onramp into Azure”
	· “Enormous amount of capabilities and material wrapped up into one great package”
	· “Better understanding of how the products work together”

This "Event in a Box" type of delivery is built on an open source platform so it can grow and change as the exam changes.  Additional topics for enhancing skills can be found at the parent github site https://github.com/guruskill.  We are already working on the 70-475 (Big Data) and hope to have many more ready in the coming months.

Getting Started:

This is the home landing location for the CY 2017 Q3 (July-Sept 2017).  After this, the program will likely be expanded and remarketed.  This Q3 initiative is to have a full proof of concept delivery to 5 cities across the United States. The first cities selected for this proof of concept are Boston, New York City, Washington DC, Atlanta, and Minneapolis.  

The events running the primary pilot will be added as owners. Starting in Q4 we expect to roll the program out to more cities across the country, then in CY 2018 Q1 we hope to roll it out World Wide.  If others want to jump in email dstolts@microsoft.com
